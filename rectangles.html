Mini scule is a species of microhylid frog endemic to Madagascar that was described in 2019. The scientific name of the species refers to its size, being a pun on the word minuscule. It is very small, measuring only 8.4 to 10.8 mm (0.33 to 0.43 in) in snoutâ€“vent length. It has bronze underparts with a brown groin and back of the thigh, cream upperparts with brown flecking, a dark brown side of the head, and a red iris. It is known only from the Sainte Luce Reserve, where it inhabits areas with deep leaf litter near semi-permanent water bodies. Specimens of frogs from Mandena, the Vohimena mountains, the southern Anosy Mountains, and Tsitongambarika may also be of this species. Like other species in the genus Mini, it received media attention when first described due to the wordplay in its scientific name.

Mini scule was described in 2019 by herpetologist Mark Scherz and his colleagues based on an adult specimen (presumed to be male) collected in Sainte Luce Reserve in Anosy, Madagascar, in 2005.[1] The name Mini scule is a pun on the word miniscule[1] (a misspelling or variant spelling of minuscule),[3] alluding to the fact that the species is among the smallest known species of frog. The specific name scule is regarded as an invariable noun.[1] Along with Mini mum and Mini ature, the other two species in its genus, the species received publicity when it was first described due to its humorous scientific name.[4][5]

The species is part of Microhylidae, a widespread family of more than 650 species of mostly small frogs. It is most closely related to Mini ature, with these two species forming a sister clade to Mini mum. The study that described the species placed the genus Mini as a sister to Plethodontohyla, despite the former being morphologically more similar to Stumpffia.[1] However, a 2021 phylogeny by Alain Dubois and colleagues instead suggests that to be monophyletic, both Plethodontohyla and Mini should be lumped with Cophyla. This would make the present species's name Cophyla scule.[6]
